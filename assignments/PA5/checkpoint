PA5 Checkpoint Questions
------------------------

The following are several questions which should help you to
understand features of the project, and suggestions on how to better
implement the project.  Answer them and submit by running 
'submit PA5-checkpoint'


Much of this project involves outputting code which properly interacts
with the library code, which is documented both in the tour of the cool
support files and as comments to the library code itself:
~cs164/lib/trap.handler.


1)  Which library functions will your generated code call directly?
(Other functions in trap.handler, such as most garbage collector
routines, are only called by other library functions.)  What is the
calling convention for these library functions?




2) How is your code supposed to interact with the garbage collector?
What is the root set in the registers (i.e., what registers does it
examine)?  How do you select which garbage collector is used?




(Initially, you may choose to test your code generator without using a
garbage collector.  After we discuss garbage collection in class, you
should revisit these issues.  For instance, you should think about
what kinds of values can be stored on the stack and in attributes.)


3)  How does your program start up?




4)  How does Cool perform arithmetic operations?




5)  How do you turn a string reference into the appropriate string
constant?  Same for an integer?
